# Angela Wu (Ruoxi Wu)

Hi! I’m Angela — a UC Berkeley ’27 Data Science student. My interests span ML/LLMs, quantitative modeling, and the engineering discipline of translating prototypes into dependable, maintainable systems.
Beyond building, I’m committed to widening access to technical education. Through 1:1 mentorship on Curious Cardinals, I help students design structured learning plans, complete projects end-to-end, and meaningfully reduce the entry barriers to rigorous STEM content.


## What I’m into right now
- **Transformer/LLM fundamentals** 
- **Fine-tuning + evaluation** 
- **Systems-y ML** 
- **Algorithms** 


## Projects — Research / ML (selected)
### 🚀 Mini-Transformer from Scratch + Ablations
From-scratch attention/FFN/LayerNorm/residuals + toy LM + structured ablations.  
- Repo: <link> 

### 🧬 GeneLLM / DNABERT Fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA) + Systematic Experiments
Config-driven training pipeline + controlled sweeps + evaluation harness.  
- Repo: <link> 

### ⚙️ LLM Serving Benchmarks (Quantization + KV Cache + Dynamic Batching)
Benchmark harness for QPS / P50/P95 / VRAM / quality drop across settings.  
Repo: <link> 

## Projects — Engineering / Optimization
### 🧠 Algorithm Optimization (NVIDIA labs): Comparing QAOA and QE-MTS
Implemented/optimized MST-related algorithms with attention to correctness, complexity, and runtime.  
Repo: <link>

### 🎮 RL Training Environment (derived from CS61B final project)
Built an RL-friendly environment around a structured problem setup; focused on clean state/action design + reproducible training runs.  
Repo: <link>


## Theory / Learning (for people with zero foundation)
I write “start-from-zero” notes while taking courses — the goal is: **no background required**.

### 📚 Obsidian Notes: CS61B → CS170 → Networks
- Data structures → algorithmic thinking → network fundamentals  
- Lots of diagrams, examples, and “why this works” explanations  
Notes can be found here: <link> 

> If you’re learning these topics and want something approachable, feel free to skim and steal the structure.
