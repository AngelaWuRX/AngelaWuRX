# About me 🤗
Hi! I’m Angela — a UC Berkeley ’27 Data Science student with an emphasis on Business and Industrial Analytics. My interests span ML/LLMs, quantitative modeling, and the engineering discipline of translating prototypes into dependable, maintainable systems.

Beyond building, I’m committed to widening access to technical education. Through 1:1 mentorship on Curious Cardinals, I help students design structured learning plans, complete projects end-to-end, and meaningfully reduce the entry barriers to rigorous STEM content.

Off-screen, I’m a sports nerd; basketball 🏀 and tennis 🎾, former competitive swimmer 🏊‍♀️, now a Cal Swimming coach intern—and I’m building a training log app for amateur swimmers based on what I’ve learned from daily practice.

# ⭐ Notes (my fav thing)
I keep a public Obsidian vault where I rewrite algorithm ideas for people with **zero background** because I found it interesting:
- clear definitions and “why this works”
- data structures → algorithmic thinking → network fundamentals  
- lots of worked examples + common pitfalls (working on adding leetcode practices)
- occasional blogs on papers I read (and what I think matters)
- some math prereq with real examples on how they will be implemented

> If you’re learning CS61B / CS170 / networks and want something approachable, feel free to skim and steal the structure.

# What I’m into right now
- **Transformer** 
- **Fine-tuning + evaluation** 
- **Systems-y ML** 
- **Algorithms**
