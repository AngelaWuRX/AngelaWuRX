# Angela Wu (Ruoxi Wu)

Hi! I’m Angela — a UC Berkeley ’27 Data Science student who likes building things that actually run.
I’m into ML/LLMs, quant research, and the engineering details that make models fast + reproducible.

---

## What I’m into right now
- **Transformer/LLM fundamentals** (mechanisms + ablations, not just “used HuggingFace”)
- **Fine-tuning + evaluation** (controlled experiments, reproducible pipelines)
- **Systems-y ML** (latency/memory tradeoffs, benchmarking, profiling)
- **Algorithms** (when math meets implementation)

---

## Research interests (loose, evolving)
- Sequence modeling + representation learning  
- Time series + cross-sectional prediction  
- Efficient training/inference (quantization, caching, batching)  
- Evaluation: how to design experiments that actually mean something

## Projects — Research / ML (selected)
### 🚀 Mini-Transformer from Scratch + Ablations
From-scratch attention/FFN/LayerNorm/residuals + toy LM + structured ablations.  
Repo: <link> • Report: <link>

### 🧬 GeneLLM / DNABERT Fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA) + Systematic Experiments
Config-driven training pipeline + controlled sweeps + evaluation harness.  
Repo: <link> • Report: <link>

### ⚙️ LLM Serving Benchmarks (Quantization + KV Cache + Dynamic Batching)
Benchmark harness for QPS / P50/P95 / VRAM / quality drop across settings.

## Projects — Engineering / Optimization
### 🧠 Algorithm Optimization (NVIDIA labs): MST + performance-focused implementation
Implemented/optimized MST-related algorithms with attention to correctness, complexity, and runtime.  
Repo: <link>

### 🎮 RL Training Environment (derived from CS61B-style projects)
Built an RL-friendly environment around a structured problem setup; focused on clean state/action design + reproducible training runs.  
Repo: <link>

---

## Theory / Learning (for people with zero foundation)
I write “start-from-zero” notes while taking courses — the goal is: **no background required**.

### 📚 Obsidian Notes: CS61B → CS170 → Networks
- Data structures → algorithmic thinking → network fundamentals  
- Lots of diagrams, examples, and “why this works” explanations  
Notes repo: <link> (or GitHub Pages link)

> If you’re learning these topics and want something approachable, feel free to skim and steal the structure.
